:description: Explain how a "description" document metadata element is used \
to record "card" information for the corkboard view

In asciidoc, you can use the built-in
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/document/metadata/#description[`:description:`]
document attribute.

Since `bart` uses `markdown2` to render markdown documents, you can use any
syntax supported by the
https://github.com/trentm/python-markdown2/wiki/metadata[`metadata`] extra to
provide the "description" metadata. For example, you might include the following
at the top of a document:

[source, yaml]
----
---
description: >
  When the hero awakes to discover that she has overslept her
  economics exam.
